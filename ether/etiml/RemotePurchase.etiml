(*
Suppose the good's price is P.
1. Buyer and seller each puts up 2P as deposits.
2. If timeout before next step, both can get back their money.
3. Seller signal 'Shipped'. From this point on, neither can get any money back unless the transaction goes through. It's unclear whose hand the good is in now. A lose-lose situation hopefully will disincentivise each party from abandoning the transaction.
4. Buyer signal 'Received'.
5. Buyer can withdraw P. Seller can withdraw 3P.
